	abstract = {There is a great interest today in voice communication over the Internet ({VoIP).} If the Internet were to become the universal network for all communications needs, and thus were to displace the telephone network for voice communication, it must be capable of providing the same level of service quality as the telephone network. Today, this does not seem to be the case. {VoIP} is plagued with packet loss and variable packet delay in the network. Although measures are taken to overcome these problems (e.g., loss concealment and adaptive playout), their effectiveness is limited to certain ranges of network conditions. Thus it is of great importance to understand the packet loss and delay characteristics of today's Internet, in order to understand the effectiveness of the measures introduced to overcome the impairments. To that end, we examine in detail measurements of packet loss and delay taken over the Internet, and give a characterization thereof. We then comment on the impact that they can have on the quality of {VoIP}, and on the effectiveness of the measures introduced to minimize their impact. This study is limited to measurements taken only on Internet backbone networks, which represent important components in long distance communication. It reveals that packet loss and delay characteristics are not consistent across all backbone networks. Some backbone networks exhibit fairly good characteristics and may offer good quality communication, leading to a confirmation that packet voice is a sound approach. Other backbone networks exhibit undesirable characteristics that could not be accommodated with any of the measures introduced today. We comment on the possible causes and on the improvements that need to be made in the Internet backbone networks to render them adequate f...},

	abstract = {Internet telephony has rapidly becoming an integral part of life. Due to its low incremental cost and the wide availability of voice over {IP} ({VoIP)} based services these services being used by nearly everyone. Today there are many {VoIP} applications available in the market, but most of them lack basic security features. Because people use {VoIP} services via public hotspots and shared local area networks these {VoIP} applications are vulnerable to attacks, such as eavesdropping. Today, there is a great need for {VoIP} applications with high quality security. {MiniSIP} is an open-source {VoIP} application platform, initially developed at {KTH.} High quality security has been a major focus of {MiniSIP} developments by several students, including the first public implementations of the secure real-time protocol ({SRTP)} and the Multimedia Key Exchange ({MIKEY)} protocol. {MiniSIP} implements secure end-to-end {VoIP} services. In addition, {MiniSIP} implements features such as dynamically choosing the most appropriate {CODEC} during a call, implementing calling policies, etc. However, it suffers from having a complicated {GUI} that requires the use of many libraries, rendering it both hard to build and hard support {\textendash} both of which make it unsuitable for commercial purposes. Web browser plug-ins are shared libraries that users install to extend the functionality of their browser. For example, a plug-in can be used to display content that the browser itself cannot display natively. For example, Adobe's reader plugin displays {PDF} files directly within the web browser. Real Network{\textquoteright}s Streaming video player utilizes a browser plug-in to provide support for live video streaming within a web page. Adobe{\textquoteright}s Flash player plugin is required to load or view any Flash contents {\textendash} such as video or animations. The goal of this thesis project is remove the problem of the existing {MiniSIP} {GUIs} by developing a Firefox browser plug-in for the {MiniSIP} application that will utilize a web-browser based {GUI.} The prototype that will be designed, implemented, and evaluated will implement an open-source {VoIP} application that is easy for a Firefox browser user to install and will be easy to use via a web interface. The long term goal is to facilitate an ordinary user to utilize {VoIP} communication via their web browser. A secondary goal is to re-use the code within {MiniSIP}, while using the web-browser to provide the {GUI.}},

	abstract = {This master thesis presents, examines, designs, implements, and evaluates with respect to energy efficiency a secure and robust {VoIP} system. This system utilizes a Session Initiation Protocol ({SIP)} infrastructure assisted by a cloud service, specifically focusing on small to medium sized enterprises ({SME)} and homes. This research focuses on using inexpensive, flexible, commodity embedded hardware (specifically a Linksys {WRT54GL} wireless router for the local site with a customized operating system, specifically {DD-WRT).} The idea is to reduce the local site's power consumption to very low levels by examining which functions can be done in a cloud service rather than at the local site. The thesis presents the design of a low-power {IP} telephony system for the local site and the cloud site. A number of different usage scenarios and desirable features are described. The methodology for conducting a set of experiments is defined to perform stress-testing and to evaluate the low- power {IP} telephony system's design. The experiments concern the overall power consumption of the local site under various configurations, the {VPN} link's call capacity, the {QoS} metrics for the {VoIP} calls, the session request delay ({SRD)} and the registration request delay ({RRD).} The results from these experiments show that there is a potential for significant power savings when using the proposed design for an {IP} telephony system.},

It is common for any individual to be associated with a number of heterogeneous communication devices (such as phones, pagers, {PDAs)} or a variety of applications (such as e-mail, instant messaging, or chat-rooms). This phenomenon has spurred a great demand for unifie dcommunication [20] services which integrate one's various communication mechanisms in a meaningful and seamless fashion. To meet this demand, the research community and communication industry are experimenting and building Internet-based, unified communication network systems ({UCN)} in which heterogeneous devices are unified for individuals and access networks are linked together through a core {IP} network. In this paper, we investigate the mobility issues in {UCN} systems. We discuss traditional mobility problems such as personal mobility and terminal mobility in the new {UCN} context, and present our design, analysis, and implementation of a new form of mobility in {UCNs}, service mobility [12] where active services can be retained across heterogeneous devices and networks.},

	abstract = {In This work a fractal analysis study of {VoIP} traffic is presented. The characteristics of measured {VoIP} traffic on both call and packet level have been investigated. The results support the popular Poisson process for {VoIP} call arrival modeling but we argue that the call holding times follow heavy-tailed distributions rather than exponential distributions. We propose the generalized Pareto distribution for modeling the call holding times. At the packet level we have found that the exponential modeling of on and off periods is also inappropriate and heavy-tailed characteristics have been identified in case of all the investigated {VoIP} codecs. The generalized Pareto distribution can be used as an accurate model for the on and off periods too. In the analysis we revealed that the aggregated {VoIP} traffic has fractal characteristics and we suggest the fractional Gaussian noise model for the aggregated {VoIP} traffic.},

While project-related issues are covered well by the V-Model 97, organizational aspects leave room for improvement. The algorithm specified by the {CMM} Appraisal Framework sees the V-Model 97 at level 1 whereas a {BOOTSTRAP-based} algorithm results in a more appropriate rating of level 2.},

Systemic knowledge is the holistic understanding of interpersonal expectations or norms, the technical system, and the relationships between the two.

The V-model validates systemic knowledge by testing the strength of a chain of evidence that emerges from the application of design principles to a practical knowledge management problem.},
